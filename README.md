# Module 4 - Fourth Challenge

For this challenge, I made a Java Script quiz. The quiz consists of five questions. When not answering the questions correctly, 20 seconds are deducted from the time, and one point gets subtracted from the final score.

## Quiz Sections

1. A landing page, giving brief instructions on the quiz and button to begin. 

2. Five sets of questions with multiple-choice options. Also, a timer is added to this part of the quiz, so the user knows how much time is left. 

3. The user has an option to enter their name to records their scores on the scoreboard. 

4. Lastly, the "Current Scores" page enlists all users who have taken the test and invites them to re-take the exam.
